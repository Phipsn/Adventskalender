    <h3>Riddles and Process</h3>

    <div class="faq">
        <button class="faq-question">12. What kind of riddles are they? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The riddles are wrapped in charming short stories by Mats the raccoon and Roxy the fox. The stories often contain hints and tips "between the lines", but the task is always clearly stated. Mostly, they are not general knowledge questions (e.g., "What is the capital of xyz?") or classic puzzles. It is more about combining and figuring out how a hint might be interpreted. It’s not about knowledge but about thinking and researching.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="faq">
        <button class="faq-question">13. What kind of stories are they? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The riddles come with short stories (about 2 A4 pages) from Mats the raccoon and Roxy the fox. The stories are designed like a children's book. If you wish, you can receive additional stories without puzzles from December 1-24.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <button class="faq-question">14. How long do I have to answer? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can answer until the next riddle is published. On Saturdays, you have one day, otherwise several days. It usually doesn’t take longer than a few minutes to solve a riddle.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq">
        <button class="faq-question">15. What happens if I can't solve a riddle? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>You can still participate and solve the other riddles, but you will no longer be eligible for the prizes. EXCEPTION: It’s possible that you aren’t the only one who couldn’t solve a riddle. If everyone has struggled with the same riddle, the person with the most correct answers wins – so you could still win. Keep solving!</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="faq">
        <button class="faq-question">16. How are the riddles published? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
